# intro

## who am i? well, that's quite easy

i'm a web developer that falls into the seniority level of "junior" —mostly because of my lack of work experience rather than lack of skills. who would've thought?—.

it was the year of 2020, i was getting sick and tired of college, i found out rather late that i simply wasn't fit for the degree i was pursuing. i began to learn programming out of personal interest and a desire for better oportunities both in knowledge and job prospects.

after getting the basics, i dived down into web development. one would think my first programming language was javascript, since what i mostly do nowadays is for the web, but it was c# actually. with enough practice, i felt myself confident enough for job hunting, but my self from then didn't expect the big and large disappointment i was met with.

none of my prospects, none of my life objectives, nothing became a reality.

still, lifes goes on.

despite the many failures, i haven't quit. i will continue to sharpen my skills, gain knowledge, keep training both my mind and body. if life was a game it would be one of the hardest and most unfair. i'm not going to lose, after all i'm a little bit of a bad loser on videogames.
